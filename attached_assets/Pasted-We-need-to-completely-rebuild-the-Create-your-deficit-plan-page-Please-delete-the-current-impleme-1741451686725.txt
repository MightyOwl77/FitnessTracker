We need to completely rebuild the "Create your deficit plan" page. Please delete the current implementation and create a new version with the following specifications:

1) Initial Calculation:
   - Calculate and display TDEE (Basal Metabolic Rate Ã— 1.2) as the maintenance calorie level
   - Use the Mifflin-St Jeor formula for BMR calculation
   - Include a brief explanation that maintenance calories represent the energy needed to maintain current weight with minimal activity
   - Display this as "Base Maintenance: X calories/day"

2) Activity Tracking Section:
   - Allow users to input:
     * Number of weekly strength training sessions (with estimated calories per session)
     * Number of weekly cardio sessions (with duration and intensity options)
     * Daily step goal with automatic calorie calculation
   - Calculate and display total weekly activity calories
   - Show updated TDEE with activity included
   - Update values in real-time as users adjust inputs

3) Calorie Intake Selection:
   - Implement a slider for users to select daily calorie intake
   - Set maximum value to their total TDEE (maintenance)
   - Set minimum value to 75% of TDEE (25% deficit)
   - Display the selected deficit as both calories and percentage
   - Include a visual indicator showing deficit level (moderate/aggressive)
   - Update in real-time as the slider moves

4) Macronutrient Distribution:
   - Calculate and display recommended macros based on scientific principles:
     * Protein: 1.8-2.2g per kg of bodyweight
     * Fat: 0.8-1g per kg of bodyweight
     * Remaining calories from carbohydrates
   - Display macros in both grams and percentage of total calories
   - Include brief explanations of the role of each macronutrient

5) Summary Section:
   - Create a clear daily summary showing:
     * Total calories in (from food)
     * Total calories out (base TDEE + activities)
     * Net deficit/surplus
     * Estimated weekly weight change
   - Include a simple visualization of the calorie balance
   - Add an option to save or export the plan

Implement proper validation to prevent physiologically unsafe values and ensure all calculations update in real-time as the user makes adjustments.
