Navigation Structure
	•	Top Navigation Bar & Mobile Navigation:
A top bar with clear labels like “Input Data,” “Set Goals,” etc., allows users to navigate intuitively. The collapsible menu for mobile ensures that the experience remains uncluttered on smaller screens.
Recommendations:
	•	Consider adding visual indicators (e.g., active state highlights) to help users understand their current stage.
	•	Ensure that transitions between stages are smooth, with possible animation cues to signal movement or progress.

Welcome/Login Page
	•	Design Elements:
Including an app logo, tagline, and a clear call-to-action (login or continue as guest) creates a welcoming atmosphere. The onboarding modal with a 4-step introduction is a great way to educate first-time users without overwhelming them.
Recommendations:
	•	Use an engaging illustration or background image that reinforces the brand identity.
	•	Provide concise messaging in the onboarding modal, possibly with progress indicators to show how many steps are remaining.

User Data Collection (Stage 1)
	•	Form & Interaction:
A simple, well-labeled form is essential here. The “Calculate BMR” button and results card provide immediate feedback, which reinforces the user’s input.
Recommendations:
	•	Integrate inline validation and real-time error messaging (e.g., for invalid inputs).
	•	Consider using a progress bar if this is part of a multi-step form to guide users visually through the process.

Weight Loss Goals (Stage 2)
	•	Dynamic Calculations & Feedback:
Displaying current stats and dynamic calculations (e.g., total deficit, weekly rate) helps users see the impact of their inputs. Warning alerts for overly aggressive goals are critical for user safety.
Recommendations:
	•	Use visual cues like color changes (e.g., red for warnings, green for safe ranges) to make alerts more intuitive.
	•	Include tooltips or brief descriptions next to complex metrics, ensuring users understand the calculations behind their goals.

View Plan (Stage 3)
	•	Plan Overview & Customization:
A clear summary of the personalized plan is essential. Presenting the nutrition table and training schedule in card formats can simplify complex data.
Recommendations:
	•	Enable quick edits directly on the plan view, allowing users to adjust parameters if needed.
	•	Use visual hierarchies such as bold fonts or contrasting colors to highlight key numbers (e.g., daily calorie targets).

Daily Log (Stage 4)
	•	Logging Efficiency & Real-Time Calculation:
The detailed log page for daily tracking is central to user engagement. Pre-filled data (e.g., BMR) and immediate deficit calculations can motivate users to log consistently.
Recommendations:
	•	Streamline the form with segmented inputs (e.g., grouping macros and calories out in collapsible sections) to reduce cognitive load.
	•	Consider implementing a “quick log” feature for days when users want to log minimal data.

Body Stats (Stage 5)
	•	Data Visualization & Analysis:
Graphs and charts to track weight, body fat, and muscle trends are excellent for helping users visualize progress. The option to export data or reset graphs adds a professional touch.
Recommendations:
	•	Use interactive charts that allow users to hover over data points for more details.
	•	Incorporate filters or date range selectors that are intuitive, possibly using sliders for a seamless experience.

Dashboard
	•	Holistic Overview:
The dashboard serves as the hub, providing quick access to key metrics, logs, and motivational content. This summary view is vital for user retention.
Recommendations:
	•	Ensure that quick action buttons are prominently displayed with clear icons and labels.
	•	Integrate dynamic widgets that update in real time, reinforcing user progress and encouraging daily engagement.
